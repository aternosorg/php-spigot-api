Nothing more, nothing less.\n\nIf you want anything more than this, then I've suggested some alternatives you can try below.\n\n[B]Why bother creating something so basic when there are obviously better plugins out there?\n[/B]\nSome people just want something simple - EssentialsChat has always been my go-to, but some people don't want the whole of Essentials on their server.\n\n[B]How do I use it?\n[/B]\nAdd it to your plugins folder, restart your server, and the config file will be generated automatically in /plugins/VaultChatFormatter.\n\n[B]Why does it depend on Vault?\n[/B]\nVault is an API (a utility) which allows plugins (like this one) to pull permissions and chat data from a variety of sources without depending on and hooking with each individual source.\n\nYou can download Vault from its official download pages below:\n[LIST]\n[*][URL='https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/']Spigot[/URL]\n[*][URL='https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault']BukkitDev[/URL]\n[/LIST]\nIn order to set prefixes (and use this plugin), you also need a permissions plugin which implements the Vault Chat API. I've listed some popular choices below - but most permissions plugins are supported.\n[LIST]\n[*][URL='https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/28140/']LuckPerms[/URL] (written by me)\n[*][URL='https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/permissionsex']PermissionsEx[/URL]\n[*][URL='https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/11736/']zPermissions[/URL]\n[*][URL='https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/bpermissions']bPermissions[/URL]\n[/LIST]\n\n[B]This plugin doesn't do enough, I want more.[/B]\nOk, try these:\n[LIST]\n[*][URL='https://github.com/drtshock/Essentials']EssentialsX + EssentialsXChat[/URL] ( [URL='https://ci.akpmakes.tech/job/EssentialsX/']download[/URL] )\n[*][URL='https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/chatex']ChatEx[/URL]\n[*][URL='https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/deluxechat.1277/']DeluxeChat[/URL]\n[*][URL='https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/deluxechat.1277/']ChatControl[/URL]\n[*][URL='https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/bungee-chat.12592/']BungeeChat[/URL]\n[/LIST]\n[B]Can I see the source code?[/B]\n[URL='https://github.com/lucko/VaultChatFormatter/blob/master/src/main/java/me/lucko/chatformatter/ChatFormatterPlugin.java']Yes[/URL].\n[B]\nIs this plugin affiliated with or endorsed by the Vault project?[/B]\nNo - it's not. It is named VaultChatFormatter because it uses Vault to retrieve prefix & suffix data.\n[B]\nCan you add x feature?[/B]\nNo."
